A readme.md generator

##Technology

This application was created using node.js and different npm modules to create a readme.md generator to use for any project as is currently done for all projects that i have
submitted .

##Description

The app is invoked in the command line and than returns a series of questions in the terminal that the user must answer to generate an accurate readme. There are also choices
for which license the user would like to use and an icon is generated after the choice and added to the top of the readme.
